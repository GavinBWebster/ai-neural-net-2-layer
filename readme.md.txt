# ai-neural-net-2-layer

Build a 2 Layer Neural Net (python 3 working edition)

## Intro

This is the working code (debugged for Python 3) for "A Neural Network in 11 lines of Python" by Andrew Trask found [here.](http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/)

##Overview

This fixes minor syntax issues for Python 3 compatability. 

##Dependencies

Just Numpy, import numpy as np

##Usage

Run python main.py in terminal to see it train.

##Credits

Credits go to [Andrew Trask](https://github.com/iamtrask) for the original code. I've modified the code ever so lightly so it works in Python 3.

NB I used Python version 3.7.1 + Sublime Text 3 version 3.2.1, Build 3207, at the time of this update/commit.
